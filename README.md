Here's a **README.md** template for your **Next.js Todo App** that only includes the frontend:

# Simple Todo App - Frontend

A **Todo Application** built using **Next.js** for the frontend. This app allows users to manage tasks, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos. The app communicates with an external Express API for backend functionality.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- Responsive UI using **Tailwind CSS**.
- Fetches tasks from an Express API.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **API**: Express.js (Assumed to be running separately, not part of this repo)

---

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- The backend API should be up and running (Express API for tasks management). The frontend assumes the backend is running on **http://localhost:4000**.

### Steps to Run the Application

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/todo-app-frontend.git
cd todo-app-frontend
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

#### 4. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app on **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.
